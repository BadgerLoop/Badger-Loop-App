    "content": "Hyperloop is a lightning-fast transportation technology that will completely revolutionize modern transit. Since its proposal by Elon Musk in 2013, the innovative idea has evolved into a clearly influential technology of our near-future. Ultimately, the design consists of a levitating pod traveling at nearly 760 miles per hour through an evacuated steel tube. The low pressure minimizes drag forces, while contact-less magnetic levitation further diminishes energy loss. The combination of these features poise Hyperloop as the new world-wide standard for high-speed transportation efficiency.",
